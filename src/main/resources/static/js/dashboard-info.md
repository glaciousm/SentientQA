# About the Dashboard Test Data

The data displayed in the dashboard is currently placeholder/mock data that's hardcoded in the JavaScript files. It doesn't represent actual test results from your codebase yet. This is intended to demonstrate the UI capabilities before connecting to real test execution data.

## Mock Data Includes:

1. **Recent Tests**: Sample test names, classes, and statuses (PASSED, FAILED, BROKEN)
2. **Test Statistics**: Counts of total tests, passed tests, failed tests, and broken tests
3. **Charts**: Test status distribution and memory savings simulation
4. **Test Details Modals**: Sample diagnostic information for failing tests

## How to Connect Real Data:

Once your test engine is running and generating real results, you'll need to:

1. Implement REST endpoints that return actual test data in JSON format
2. Update the JavaScript files to fetch from these endpoints instead of using mock data
3. Connect the dashboard to your test execution service

The frontend is designed to be ready for this integration with minimal changes.

## JavaScript Files:

- `dashboard.js`: Contains the main dashboard logic and mock data generation
- Other JS files handle specific test types (security, compliance, etc.)

When you're ready to transition from placeholder data to real test results, refer to these files to understand the expected data format.
