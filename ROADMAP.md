- Create connectors for importing test specifications from external systems

### Advanced Self-Healing (preparation)

- Research more sophisticated algorithms for test healing
- Design the architecture for advanced self-healing capabilities
- Develop test case repair strategies based on AI suggestions

## Recent Implementation Highlights

The recent implementation has significantly advanced the Test Intelligence System with the following new components:

### Enhanced Test Execution Engine

- **EnhancedTestExecutionService**: Provides actual compilation and execution of generated tests using the Java Compiler API and JUnit Platform
- **TestDependencyManager**: Manages test dependencies and ensures all required libraries are available for test execution
- **EnhancedTestController**: Offers improved REST API endpoints for test execution with better status tracking and result reporting

These enhancements transform the previous simulation-based approach into a fully functional test execution system capable of compiling and running tests with accurate results.

### Form Data Tracking System

- **FormDataTrackingService**: Analyzes form structures, validation rules, and data flow
- **FormAnalysisController**: Provides REST API access to form analysis functionality
- Enhanced test generation for form validation with client-side rules detection

### Flow Analysis System

- **FlowAnalysisService**: Analyzes relationships between pages to identify user journeys and page transitions.
- **UserJourneyTestGenerator**: Creates end-to-end tests that simulate real user flows across multiple pages.
- **UserJourneyController**: Provides REST API access to flow analysis and user journey test generation.

### API Analysis System

- **APITestGenerationService**: Detects REST API endpoints and generates comprehensive tests.
- **APITestController**: Provides REST API access to API test generation functionality.

### Infrastructure Improvements

- **WebDriverSessionManager**: Improves performance by efficiently managing and reusing browser instances.

These new components significantly enhance the platform's capabilities for automatic test generation, particularly for form validation, end-to-end flows, and API testing. The implementation aligns with the roadmap's focus on building a comprehensive QA platform that can understand and test web applications with minimal human intervention.
