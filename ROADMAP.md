# Project Oracle: Backend Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed roadmap for implementing the backend components of Project Oracle to transform it from its current state to the fully autonomous QA platform described in the vision document. The roadmap is organized by functional components and provides specific implementation guidance for each phase.

## Current Implementation Status
### Existing Components (Before Update)

- Basic Spring Boot application structure
- AIModelService for text generation
- ModelDownloadService for fetching models from HuggingFace
- ModelQuantizationService for model optimization
- CodeAnalysisService using JavaParser
- TestGenerationService for creating tests from method signatures
- TestExecutionService (simulation only)
- TestHealingService with basic functionality
- File-based TestCaseRepository
- REST Controllers for basic operations

## Next Steps
For the next implementation phase, the focus should be on:

### Data Flow Analysis

- Implement FormDataTrackingService to analyze form submission data
- Create StateManagementAnalysisService to track application state
- Build BusinessLogicExtractionService to discover validation rules

### Knowledge Integration System

- Begin work on integration with external systems (Jira, Confluence)
- Start implementing the knowledge repository for requirements and documentation

### Test Intelligence System (continued)

- Improve test execution with actual compilation and running of tests
- Enhance self-healing capabilities with more sophisticated algorithms
- Develop test result analysis and reporting

## Recent Implementation Highlights

The recent implementation has significantly advanced the Application Analysis System with the following new components:

### Flow Analysis System

- **FlowAnalysisService**: Analyzes relationships between pages to identify user journeys and page transitions.
- **UserJourneyTestGenerator**: Creates end-to-end tests that simulate real user flows across multiple pages.
- **UserJourneyController**: Provides REST API access to flow analysis and user journey test generation.

### API Analysis System

- **APITestGenerationService**: Detects REST API endpoints and generates comprehensive tests.
- **APITestController**: Provides REST API access to API test generation functionality.

### Infrastructure Improvements

- **WebDriverSessionManager**: Improves performance by efficiently managing and reusing browser instances.

These new components significantly enhance the platform's capabilities for automatic test generation, particularly for end-to-end flows and API testing. The implementation aligns with the roadmap's focus on building a comprehensive QA platform that can understand and test web applications with minimal human intervention.

## Major Technical Gaps Remaining

- No real test execution capability (partial simulation only)
- No integration with external systems (Jira, Confluence)
- Missing data processing and analytics pipeline
- Limited model optimization and inference
- No distributed test execution infrastructure
- Incomplete self-healing capabilities
