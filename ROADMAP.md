Next Steps
For the next implementation phase, the focus should be on:

Next Steps: Immediate Implementation Focus
Based on the current state of the Project Oracle implementation, the following components should be prioritized for immediate development:
1. Knowledge Integration Framework

Create comprehensive integration service interfaces and base classes
Implement production-ready Jira and Confluence clients
Design extensible knowledge entity and relationship models
Build scalable knowledge repository with graph capabilities
Develop sophisticated knowledge extraction and processing pipeline
Implement semantic understanding for requirements
Create traceability between requirements and tests

2. Application Analysis System

Design highly scalable browser automation framework
Implement thread-safe WebDriver factory and pool
Create sophisticated session handling for multiple browsers
Build robust element identification with multi-strategy fallbacks
Develop comprehensive page analyzer with deep DOM traversal
Implement API traffic capture and analysis
Create state modeling for application behavior

3. Advanced Test Generation

Transform the current test generation with more sophisticated AI prompts
Implement test scenario extraction from requirements
Create multi-layer test design across UI, API, and data
Build test strategy optimization based on application complexity
Develop negative test case generation
Implement data variation analysis for test inputs
Create boundary test generation for edge cases

4. Real Test Execution Engine

Replace simulation with actual test compilation and execution
Implement test class loading and isolation
Create comprehensive execution result capture
Build detailed failure analysis and reporting
Develop distributed test execution framework
Implement parallel test orchestration
Create execution optimization based on resource constraints

These foundational components will provide the platform for implementing the more advanced capabilities described in the vision document and set the stage for the full realization of the autonomous QA platform.
